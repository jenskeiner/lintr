# Test Coverage Analysis

This document identifies gaps in test coverage for the Repolint project. Each gap is uniquely identified for reference in future tasks.

## Main Module (GAP-MAIN-1)
- Missing coverage for the `if __name__ == "__main__"` block in `__main__.py`
- Impact: Low - standard Python boilerplate code
- Suggested Test: Add test that runs the module as a script

## CLI Module

### Init Command Edge Cases (GAP-CLI-4)
- Missing coverage in `handle_init` (lines 191-192, 207-209)
- Impact: Medium - error handling for file operations
- Suggested Test: Add tests for file permission issues and existing files

### Main Function Edge Cases (GAP-CLI-5)
- Missing coverage in `main` (lines 222, 243, 247)
- Impact: Low - error handling for argument parsing
- Suggested Test: Add tests with invalid command line arguments

## Linter Module

### Interactive Fix Mode (GAP-LINTER-1)
- Missing coverage for interactive fix prompts (lines 116-117)
- Impact: High - user interaction for applying fixes
- Suggested Test: Add tests simulating user input for fix confirmation

### Fix Application Error Handling (GAP-LINTER-2)
- Missing coverage for fix application errors (lines 137-140, 143-145)
- Impact: High - error handling during fix operations
- Suggested Test: Add tests for failed fix operations

## Rule Manager Module

### Entry Point Loading (GAP-RULE-MGR-1)
- Missing coverage for entry point loading errors (lines 43-45, 58-60)
- Impact: Medium - error handling for invalid plugins
- Suggested Test: Add tests with invalid/malformed entry points

### Rule Set Configuration (GAP-RULE-MGR-2)
- Missing coverage for rule set configuration validation (lines 103-105)
- Impact: High - configuration validation
- Suggested Test: Add tests with invalid rule set configurations

### Rule Creation Edge Cases (GAP-RULE-MGR-3)
- Missing coverage for rule creation errors (lines 114, 125-126, 141)
- Impact: Medium - error handling for rule instantiation
- Suggested Test: Add tests with invalid rule parameters

### Rule Set Management (GAP-RULE-MGR-4)
- Missing coverage for rule set management (lines 160, 227-230, 238)
- Impact: High - core rule set functionality
- Suggested Test: Add tests for complex rule set operations

## Base Rules Module

### Rule Execution Edge Cases (GAP-RULES-1)
- Missing coverage in `base.py` (lines 55, 71)
- Impact: Medium - error handling in rule execution
- Suggested Test: Add tests for edge cases in rule execution

## Test Coverage Metrics

Current overall coverage: 91%
- Lines covered: 486
- Lines missing: 51
- Total lines: 537

## Priority Areas

High priority gaps that should be addressed first:
1. GAP-CLI-2: GitHub token validation
2. GAP-LINTER-1: Interactive fix mode
3. GAP-LINTER-2: Fix application error handling
4. GAP-RULE-MGR-2: Rule set configuration
5. GAP-RULE-MGR-4: Rule set management

## Next Steps

1. Address high priority gaps first
2. Focus on error handling scenarios
3. Add tests for user interaction flows
4. Improve coverage of configuration validation
5. Add tests for plugin system edge cases
