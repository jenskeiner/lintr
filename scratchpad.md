# Current Task: Test Custom Rule Usage in Linter

## Task Description
Add integration tests that verify custom rules are properly created and used in real linting scenarios.

## Plan

### 1. Understand Current Rule Implementation
[X] Check how base rules are implemented
    - Rules are Python classes inheriting from `Rule` base class
    - Each rule has a unique ID, description, and optional configuration
    - Rules implement `check()` method to validate repository settings
    - Rules can optionally implement `fix()` method to fix issues
[X] Identify where and how rules are loaded and executed
    - Rules are discovered through entry points
    - Custom rules are created by `RuleManager._add_custom_rules()`
    - Rules are executed through their `check()` method with a `RuleContext`
[X] Understand rule configuration handling
    - Rules use Pydantic models for configuration
    - Custom rules can override base rule configuration
    - Repository-specific configurations are applied at runtime

### 2. Design Test Scenarios
[X] Create test cases for:
  - Custom rule inheriting from `DefaultBranchExistsRule` with custom configuration
  - Custom rule overriding configuration at repository level
  - Custom rule in a ruleset alongside built-in rules
  - Multiple custom rules working together

### 3. Implementation Steps
[X] Create test fixtures for GitHub repository mock data
    - Mock repository with default branch
    - Mock repository settings
[X] Create test configuration with custom rules
[X] Write test cases verifying rule execution
[X] Add test cases for error scenarios

### 4. Success Criteria
[X] Custom rules are properly instantiated with correct configuration
[X] Custom rules correctly inherit behavior from base rules
[X] Repository-specific configurations are applied correctly
[X] Rule validation results are as expected
[X] Error cases are handled properly

## Progress
[X] Understood rule implementation and loading mechanism
[X] Created test fixtures
[X] Implemented test cases:
    - test_custom_default_branch_rule: Basic custom rule inheritance
    - test_custom_rule_with_config: Configuration override
    - test_repository_specific_config: Repository-level config
    - test_custom_rule_in_ruleset: Rule set integration
    - test_invalid_custom_rule: Error handling for invalid base
    - test_invalid_custom_rule_config: Error handling for invalid config
[ ] Run tests and verify all scenarios pass

## Next Steps
1. Run the tests to verify everything works
2. Update the project plan to mark step 2.6 as complete
