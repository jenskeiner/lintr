Below is a detailed outline in Markdown format that describes the concept for comprehensive user documentation. You can later provide this outline back to me so I can generate the full documentation.

  • Overview: What Lintr is and why it exists  
  • Problem statement: Enforcing consistent settings across GitHub repositories  
  • Key features and benefits

- Who should use Lintr?  
  • Repository maintainers  
  • DevOps engineers  
  • Developers interested in automating repository hygiene

- Quick demo or summary screenshot (if applicable)

------------------------------------------------------------

## 2. Getting Started

### 2.1 Prerequisites

- Dependencies and how to install them

### 2.2 Installation

- Cloning the repository from GitHub  
- Installation instructions (using pip or from source)  
- Setting up virtual environments (if needed)  
- How to install extra dependencies (if any)

### 2.3 Setup and Configuration

- Overview of configuration files  
  • Default configuration file (.lintr.yml)  
- Environment variables and .env file usage  
- Instructions for first-time setup using the CLI init command

------------------------------------------------------------

## 3. Usage

### 3.1 Command-line Interface Overview

- General help and usage message (how to get help)

### 3.2 Available Commands

#### 3.2.1 lint Command

- Purpose of linting repositories  
- Options and flags:  
  • --config  
  • --fix  
  • --non-interactive  
  • --include-organisations  
  • --dry-run  
- Explanation of output and what to expect (colored status symbols, messages)

#### 3.2.2 list Command

- Listing available rules and rule sets  
- Description of flags:  
  • --rules  
  • --rule-sets  
- How the output is organized

#### 3.2.3 init Command

- Explanation of the default_config template  
- Next steps for configuration editing after initialization

------------------------------------------------------------

## 4. Configuration Details

### 4.1 Configuration File Structure

- Overview of the YAML configuration file (.lintr.yml)  
- Key configuration sections:  
  • github_token (authentication)  
  • repository_filter (include/exclude patterns)  
  • rules, rule_sets, default_rule_set, repository_rule_sets  
- Detailed examples for each configuration section

### 4.2 Environment Variables

- How to set GitHub tokens via environment variables

## 5. How Lintr Works (Architecture Overview)

### 5.1 Code Structure and Modules

- Overview of the main packages and modules:  
  • lintr/__init__.py – Project metadata  
  • lintr/cli.py – Command line parsing and command handling  
  • lintr/config.py – Configuration management and YAML loading  
  • lintr/gh.py – GitHub API integration  
  • lintr/linter.py – Core lint logic  
  • lintr/rule_manager.py – Rule discovery and management  
  • lintr/rules/ – Definition of rules, rule sets, and their factories

### 5.2 Execution Flow

- How the CLI processes command-line arguments  
- How configuration is loaded and validated  
- How the GitHub client retrieves repositories  
- How rules and rule sets are discovered and applied to repositories  
- Explanation of the linting process and output reporting

------------------------------------------------------------

## 6. Extending and Customizing Lintr

### 6.1 Creating Custom Rules

- Guiding principles for writing new rules  
- How to implement a custom rule by extending the base Rule class  
- Required attributes and methods (e.g., _id, _description, check(), fix())  
- Sample code snippet demonstrating custom rule creation

### 6.2 Creating and Registering Custom Rule Sets

- How to define a new rule set programmatically  
- Registering custom rules with RuleManager and RuleSetFactory  
- Example configuration snippet to include custom rule sets in .lintr.yml

### 6.3 Advanced Configuration Options

- How to override default rule configurations for specific repositories  
- Best practices for repository filtering and using include/exclude patterns  
- Tips for using nested rule sets

------------------------------------------------------------

## 7. Examples and Use Cases

### 7.1 Practical Example Walkthroughs

- Step-by-step guide to lint a repository
