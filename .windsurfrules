# Instructions

During you interaction with the user, if you find anything reusable in this project (e.g. version of a library, model name), especially about a fix to a mistake you made or a correction you received,
you should take note in the lessons section of the internal documentation in the directory `docs/internal/lessons/` so you will not make the same mistake again. Chose the appropriate file or create a
new one for a new topic. Ensure the files you modify are linked properly from the project plan in `docs/internal/project_plan.md`.

You should also use the `<project_root>/scratchpad.md` file as a scratchpad to organize your thoughts. Especially when you receive a new task, you should first review the content of the scratchpad, the project plan, 
and relevant content from the lessons section linked from there, clear old different tasks if necessary, first explain the task, and plan the steps you need to take to complete the task. You can use todo markers to indicate the progress, e.g.
[X] Task 1
[ ] Task 2
Also update the progress of the task in the Scratchpad when you finish a subtask.

Especially when you finished a milestone, it will help to improve your depth of task accomplishment to use the scratchpad to reflect and plan.
The goal is to help you maintain a big picture as well as the progress of the task. Always refer to the Scratchpad when you plan the next step.

Often, your task will be listed in the project plan in `docs/internal/project_plan.md` so ensure you tick it off as well when done.
